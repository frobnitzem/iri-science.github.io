        <p>The Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy Pathfinder is focused on the use of remote HPC by experiments running at the <a href="https://d3dfusion.org/" target="_blank">DIII-D National Fusion Facility</a> at General Atomics in San Diego, CA.</p>
        <p>Initial work on this Pathfinder has resulted in dramatic improvements to the Consistent Automatic Kinetic Equilibrium (CAKE) workflow, developed and implemented at DIII-D for producing low error, kinetically constrained reconstructions without human intervention, and to identify strategies for doing so that would be broadly applicable. The automation of CAKE using remote computing at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center has resulted in 20,000 high quality reconstructions in a 3 month period, compared to 4,000 manual reconstructions in the prior 12 years. This is one example of the ways in which multifacility workflows in the IRI framework can dramatically improve scientific productivity.</p>
        <p>The current task for the DIII-D Pathfinder team is to automate the use of the Ion Orbiter (Ion Orb) workflow, which provides  fast between-shot identification of limiter heating sources, using remote computing at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF). The idea is that after a shot that exhibits limiter heating, personnel in the control room will be able to run this module and quickly determine which neutral beams are depositing on which limiters so that they can decide how to proceed. The Ion Orbiter code simulates particle trajectories and determines their hit locations on the tokamak wall.</p>
        <p>Both of these workflows will be demonstrated by members of the Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy Pathfinder at the <a href="/events/sc24">SC24 conference</a>.</p>
