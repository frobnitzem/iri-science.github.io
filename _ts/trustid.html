    <p>The Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) TRUSTID Technical Subcommittee is established to enable
      trustworthy and performant execution of cross facility workflows. The TRUSTID subcommitteeâ€™s mission
      is to create a set of design patterns and policy elements that mitigate risks, safeguard assets, and
      enable a trusted environment for transformative open science.</p>
  <p>Cybersecurity enables open science when security architectures and technologies are effectively
      integrated into performant and functional workflow designs from the beginning. It is essential that
      security teams and other stakeholders of all sites and facilities engaged in IRI build partnerships
      to develop trusted multi-facility workflows that are acceptable to all IRI participants. It is an
      explicit goal of the IRI TRUSTID Technical Subcommittee to create the design patterns and
      collaborative relationships to bring this about.</p>
