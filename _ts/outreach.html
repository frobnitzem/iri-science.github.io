            The role of the Outreach/Engagement subcommittee is to coordinate work being done with the pathfinder
            science teams, identify common requirements and communicate to the Leadership team. This subcommittee is
            also responsible for broader community engagement, working with science teams who wish to engage more
            closely with IRI and bringing them into the IRI framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, the set of active IRI projects will expand as resources become available. The list of initial
            projects (pathfinder projects, workstreams) is an initial list of projects, not a complete list of projects
            - facilities and programs that have an interest in working in this space should work with the Engagement
            subcommittee on establishing collaboration contact points, readiness levels, requirements, and so forth.
