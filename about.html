                <p>The Department of Energy's vision for Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) is to empower
                    researchers to meld DOE's world-class research tools, infrastructure and user facilities seamlessly
                    and securely in novel ways to radically accelerate discovery and innovation. This will be achieved
                    through the seamless interoperability of research workflows, enabling researchers to gain insight
                    from observational, experimental and simulated data. Decades of research, pilot projects, and
                    demonstrations point to the extraordinary promise of IRI but also the intertwined technological,
                    policy, and sociological challenges of IRI. </p>
                <p>Initial IRI work is currently focusing on defining the structure of the IRI program, setting up the
                    appropriate sub-committees, and partnerships with pathfinder projects. As this work evolves and
                    funding emerges, we expect there to be opportunities for the broader community to engage. For
                    example, the IRI Management Council expects to convene an annual meeting to bring the community
                    together to discuss IRI goals and plans. This website describes places where we initially see
                    opportunities to engage; this will evolve rapidly as we learn from our initial experiences.</p>

                <h3>The Path to IRI</h3>
                <p>The journey to IRI started in 2020 when ASCR convened the IRI Task Force which explored the framework
                    required to better integrate DOE resources. It was followed by a series of activities designed to
                    identify pain points, gather requirements, and build community engagement around the concept of IRI.
                    The results were published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.2172/1984466" target="_blank">IRI
                        Architectural Blueprint Activity Report</a> in 2022.</p>

                <h3>Outreach and Engagement Subcommittee</h3>
                <p>The role of the Outreach/Engagement Technical subcommittee is to coordinate work being done with the
                    pathfinder science teams, identify common requirements and communicate to the Leadership team. This
                    subcommittee is also responsible for broader community engagement, working with science teams who
                    wish to engage more closely with IRI and bringing them into the IRI framework.</p>
                <p>Over time, the set of active IRI projects will expand as resources become available. The list of
                    initial Pathfinder projects is an initial list of projects, not a complete list of projects -
                    facilities and programs that have an interest in working in this space should work with the
                    Engagement subcommittee on establishing collaboration contact points, readiness levels,
                    requirements, and so forth.</p>

                <h3>Interfaces Technical Subcommittee</h3>
                <p>This IRI Interfaces Subcommittee works to gather requirements, define use cases, and specify unified
                    interfaces for the DOE ASCR Facilities. Beyond defining Application Programmable Interfaces (API),
                    this may include the integration of front end applications (e.g. jupyter notebooks) and
                    orchestration systems (including hosted orchestration tools).</p>
                <p>This group is tasked with enhancing the “user experience” for interaction and management of complex
                    workflows across High-Performance Computing Facilities, High-Performance Data Facilities, and
                    High-Performance Scientific Network Facilities, thereby facilitating a more cohesive and efficient
                    research infrastructure. The group will consider applicable standards and build upon the work of
                    other organizations where available to deliver a reference IRI interface implementation.</p>

                <h3>TRUSTID Technical Subcommittee</h3>
                <p>The Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) TRUSTID Technical Subcommittee is established to enable
                    trustworthy and performant execution of cross facility workflows. The TRUSTID subcommittee’s mission
                    is to create a set of design patterns and policy elements that mitigate risks, safeguard assets, and
                    enable a trusted environment for transformative open science.</p>
                <p>Cybersecurity enables open science when security architectures and technologies are effectively
                    integrated into performant and functional workflow designs from the beginning. It is essential that
                    security teams and other stakeholders of all sites and facilities engaged in IRI build partnerships
                    to develop trusted multi-facility workflows that are acceptable to all IRI participants. It is an
                    explicit goal of the IRI TRUSTID Technical Subcommittee to create the design patterns and
                    collaborative relationships to bring this about.</p>
