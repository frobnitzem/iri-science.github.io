                <h3>IRI Governance</h3>
                <p>One of the main activities in FY24 is to develop the program governance structure. This includes
                    three clear areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Federal oversight.</strong> This includes the IRI Executive Authority and IRI Steering
                        Committee (led by ASCR Facilities Division), and will include mechanisms for accountability to
                        other contributing offices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management Council.</strong> This includes the management structures (defined in more
                        detail below), and the Technical Subcommittees who will execute the work required. Initially,
                        this will consist primarily of ASCR staff, but will expand as funding becomes available for IRI
                        activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>User groups.</strong> This includes computing facilities, science teams.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Governance structure will be inclusive; other offices will be engaged and participate.</p>

                <p>The IRI Executive Committee is composed of ASCR facility directors. Their primarily responsibilities
                    include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scope Definition:</strong> Define the overall scope of the project based on input from
                        the DOE SC IRI Steering Committee, ensuring that the objectives are clear, achievable, and
                        aligned with IRI goals and facility missions and goals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Approach Prioritization:</strong> Prioritize the activities and approaches recommended
                        by the leadership group, determining which strategies will best achieve the IRI objectives
                        efficiently and effectively, given facility mission and resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Allocate resources (people, technical) strategically,
                        ensuring the IRI program has what it needs to succeed while efficiently using organizational
                        assets. Certain resource allocation decisions will depend on DOE acceptance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ongoing Oversight:</strong> Maintain ongoing oversight of the IRI effort, monitoring
                        progress and ensuring it remains aligned with its defined scope and objectives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual Reviews:</strong> Conduct yearly reviews of the IRI progress, assessing
                        achievements, challenges, and areas for improvement. Provide constructive feedback and
                        adjustments to strategies as necessary in collaboration with the DOE SC IRI Steering Committee.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Identify potential risks and challenges of the effort,
                        developing and implementing strategies to mitigate these risks effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication and Coordination:</strong> Facilitate open communication and coordination
                        between the IRI management council, stakeholders, and other relevant parties, ensuring that all
                        are aligned and informed.</li>

                <h4>IRI Leadership Group</h4>
                <p>The IRI leadership group consists of representatives, one from each of the 5 ASCR facilities. The
                    IRI leadership group communicates with the leads of the technical and engagement/outreach
                    subcommittees. The IRI leadership group also reports into the IRI Executive committee and is a
                    conduit for communication of objectives and progress. </p>
